# Temperature Converter

## Description
* ## Overview 
    *   In this exercise I was tasked with creating a way to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. The converter needed to have radio buttons, a submit, and clear button. It also needed an input field, and an output field to print the solution to. I was also tasked with changing the color of the output based on its value (blue=cold/red=hot/green=mild). I was also required to have an event listener for the enter key. I enjoyed this project a lot, it was challenging, and satisfying to work on.

* ## What I Learned
    * I was able to use this project as a way to solidify my understanding of functions, and how to reduce my script in a way that makes it easier to read, and write. When I originally had the color changing output complete, the function was much larger, and harder to read. I was able to reduce that to just a few lines after a few attempts.

    * I was able to learn more about Event Listeners with this project. More specifically I was able to learn about “keydown”/”keyup”, and how to add conditionals to specify which key I want to listen for.
